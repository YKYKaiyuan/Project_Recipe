**Breif introduction of this project**

This project is designed to offer a more covenient way to save recipes and track saved recipe just like how modern 
music streaming app does. For example I can save a lot of recipes into this program, and when I need to use one of 
those. I can do a direct search for that. In the circumustances when I do not know what exactly I need to cook, 
I can go into any interested catogory and just check what recipes I have saved in that catogory, 
and then I (might be able to) make the decision.
